                <p>From pixelated graphics to breathtaking realism, the history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research or just for recreation. At M.I.T. in the 1960s, professors and students played games such as 3D tic-tac-toe and Moon Landing. These games were played on computers such as the IBM 1560, and moves were made by means of punch cards. Video games did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when video arcade games and video game consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home computer games were introduced to the general public.</p>

                <p>With smartphone usage at an all-time high and with constant new technological improvements in many areas, mobile gaming has never been so easy, convenient, and affordable for users. Statista has estimated the mobile gaming market in India will be worth about 2.4 billion dollars in 2020, up from 600 million dollars in 2017. The popularity of mobile gaming is surging in India with three out of four Indian players enjoying mobile games minimum twice a day. Mobile gamers in India typically spend over an hour on their device each day â€“ this is higher than the average of around forty-five minutes a day that is spent on video services like Netflix viewership.</p>
